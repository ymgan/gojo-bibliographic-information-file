## Getting started

To begin your Unlimited Void training, please follow the steps below.

1.  Clone the Repository: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine

2.  Set Up the R Environment: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and restore the `renv` environment:

``` bash
cd gojo-bibliographic-information-file
Rscript -e 'renv::restore()'
```

This command installs the R packages specified in the `renv.lock` file, ensuring that you have the same environment as the original project.

3.  Open the R Project: Open the R project by double-clicking the `.Rproj` file in the repository. This will open the project in RStudio with all the necessary configurations.

4.  Run the Script: Navigate to the "src" directory within the project and open the R script you want to run. Execute the script in RStudio. Any output files generated by the script will be saved in the `files/` directory.
